# Villa iCrate Mount

I want to mount a ReoLink NVC-D12M camera to an iCrate's cages to monitor the dogs closely.

Note grabbag:

* ReoLink NVC-D12M, a Costco special.
* Mount is 4 52mm in a square.
* M4 screw size needed mounting.
* The iCrate cage's wire diameter is 4mm
* From edge of the wire to another wire vertically is 105mm
* Temporary, so a crappy mount is fine.
